/* This theme heavily uses Bootstrap (v5). That means, bootstrap CSS
 * classes will be used if possible and modified or enhanced by classes defined
 * in this less file (and dependent files). However, the bootstrap sources will
 * not be used and compiled in this theme for simplicity, so one served by a
 * central CDN may be used.
 *
 * Although this code shouldn't be affected by Bootstrap's licensing and/or
 * copyright, we'd like to inform anyone, that Bootstrap is licensed under the
